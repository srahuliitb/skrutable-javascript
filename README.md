# Skrutable JavaScript

This is an attempt to reproduce the Skrutable APIs (https://github.com/tylergneill/skrutable/) in JavaScript using the TDD approach.

Currently, only one method (`Scanner.test_as_anuzwuB`) is available which is to check if a given verse is an `anuṣṭubh`. 

`Scanner.test_as_anuzwuB` uses a helper method called `Scanner.test_as_anuzwuB_half`.

*All credits go to Tyler Neill (https://github.com/tylergneill) who originally developed the APIs in Python.*
